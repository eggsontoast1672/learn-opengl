# learn-opengl

As of late, I have been quite interested in the youtubers who write games from scratch in C. One such youtuber, [jdh][jdh-channel], piqued my interest with his video of writing a minecraft clone from scratch, using only C and OpenGL. Another youtuber by the name of [CodeParade][codeparade-channel] is cuurently making a game called Hperbolica, an RPG set in a non-euclidean plane of existance. His video on the non-euclidean worlds engine that he wrote using OpenGL also inspired me.

I'm very interested now in graphics programming, and I'm hoping to learn enough to write my own game engines and make youtube videos when I get older. 

Anyway, please feel free to use my code, fork it, sell it, make your own game or something with it, whatever. I'm learning OpenGL ultimately for my own enjoyment, there's no reason why my code shouldn't be open for public use. I don't see any reason to include a liscense with the repository since this isn't a serious project and I don't care about legal stuff.

Enjoy!
